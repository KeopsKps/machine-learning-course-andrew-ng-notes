    "Taking any color and going along the 'circle', one would expect to get the same value of the cost function. For example, the three green points found on the green line above have the same value for $J(\\theta_0,\\theta_1)$ and as a result, they are found along the same line. The circled x displays the value of the cost function for the graph on the left when $\\theta_0 = 800$ and $\\theta_1 = -0.15$. Taking another h(x) and plotting its contour plot, one gets the following graphs:\n",
